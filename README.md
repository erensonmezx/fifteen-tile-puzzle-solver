# 15-Tile Puzzle Solver with GUI

An interactive 15-tile sliding puzzle solver implemented in Python. This project features a graphical user interface (GUI), custom image-based tiles, and a real-time solver using the A* algorithm with Manhattan distance heuristic.

Originally created as an 8-puzzle game, it was later upgraded to a full 15-tile version.

## Features

-  **Image-Based Tiles**  
  Load any image and automatically split it into 15 tiles for gameplay.

-  **A\* Algorithm Solver**  
  Solves the puzzle optimally using the Manhattan distance heuristic.

-  **Interactive GUI with Tkinter**  
  - Shuffle into a random **solvable** state  
  - Step-by-step solution playback  
  - Manual tile movement supported

- 🔄 **Solvability Guaranteed**  
  Random states are generated by walking from the goal state, ensuring they are always solvable.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- `tkinter` – for GUI  
- `opencv-python` – for image handling  
- `Pillow` – for additional image manipulation  
- `numpy` – for numerical operations and puzzle state representation
